# UI Challenge

Create a simple web app to display list of movies. 

# Requirements

Complete as much as you can of the following. We do not expect you to be able to do everything on this list. We are just as interested in seeing how you prioritize your time as we are in seeing a fully completed app.

* Create a 'home' page displaying all available movies.
* Create a 'Movie Detail' page dedicated to an individual movie. This would be accessed by clicking into a movie from the home page.
* Style the pages in whatever way you feel comfortable.
* Make the home page sortable (by Name / Date, ascending / descending)
* Add a Search Bar to return only movies whose title contains a search term
* Paginate the home page to display 5 movies at a time.

# Setup

We provide you with a simulated API response JSON for a list of movies and a folder full of image posters.  Feel free to use whatever front end framework / libraries / styling you feel most comfortable with.

# Duration

This challenge is designed for a wide spectrum of skill levels. Please complete whatever you can in 5 hours. We do not expect (or want) you to spend a full day on this just to get the entire list of tasks done. After 5 hours of work, please zip and upload your app.  Good luck!
