# UI Challenge

Create a simple web app to display list of movies. 

# Requirements

Complete as much as you can of the following. 

#### Definites
* Create a 'home' page displaying all available movies.
* Create a 'Movie Detail' page dedicated to an individual movie. This would be accessed by clicking into a movie from the home page.
* Style the pages in whatever way you feel comfortable.

#### Bonus points
* Make the home page sortable (by Name / Date, ascending / descending)
* Add a Search Bar to return only movies whose title contains a search term
* Plan for a large number of movies on the home page - using pagination, infinite scrolling, lazy loading, etc.

# Setup

We provide you with a simulated API response JSON for a list of movies and a folder full of image posters.  Feel free to use whatever front end framework / libraries / styling you feel most comfortable with.
