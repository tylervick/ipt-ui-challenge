# UI Challenge for Disney IPT


## Requirements

#### Base
- [] Create a 'home' page displaying all available movies.
- [] Create a 'Movie Detail' page dedicated to an individual movie. This would be accessed by clicking into a movie from the home page.
- [] Style the pages in whatever way you feel comfortable.

#### Stretch
- [] Make the home page sortable (by Name / Date, ascending / descending)
- [] Add a Search Bar to return only movies whose title contains a search term
- [] Plan for a large number of movies on the home page - using pagination, infinite scrolling, lazy loading, etc.

## Implementation


I recall NextJS being preferred by the team internally. The requirements are simple enough that a "real" backend probably isn't necessary but I can still use NJS's API routes to simulate a backend API that returns the supplied JSON.

If NextJS wasn't a preference, I'd likely go with a combination of Fastify & Vite for a more simple stack.
